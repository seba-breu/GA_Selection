# Genetic gene selection through logistic regression algorithm

### Objective

Identifying important genes that contribute the most information for correctly label prediction (benign/malignant).

### How?
Using genetic algorithm for subset gene selection that maximize the prediction according to the following workflow:

1.   Vector construction: each individual is represented by a binary vector within genes selected are represented by 1 or unselected by 0.

For instance within $N = 1, 2, ..., ni$. $\vec{v1} = [1, 0, 1, ..., ni]$
